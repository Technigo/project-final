# Final Project

Creating a rentals page for renting out vacation items.

## The problem

I have created two APIs, one for storing the rentals and placing orders and one for authentication. I used postman, mongoDB compass for testing and deployed with MongoDB Atlas and render. For the frontend I deployed with Netlify.I used Figma for planning the project and making a design. If I had more time I would add more functionalities and work on the design more.
