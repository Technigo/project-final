Challenges


We faced significant challenges with two major merge conflicts, experiencing double commits that we had to resolve by using the DROP command. Managing these conflicts required careful coordination and communication to ensure no work was lost and the codebase remained stable.
Implementing the products list was another challenge. We had to perform extensive filter and sort operations in various places, which required a deep understanding of both frontend and backend logic to ensure the correct display of products. Debugging and optimizing these operations were time-consuming but crucial for the functionality of our platform.

Project Process


First, we set up a Figma board where we brainstormed and established our core values, aligning the team on the project vision, workflow, and expectations. We designed the project in Figma, working with mood boards, styling and wireframes inspired by the project where we worked with UX-designers.
We utilized Notion to work as if this was our real job, starting each morning with a standup and a meeting about the day's workload. Our Notion page included meeting notes, a project timeline, sprints, and all the tasks for the frontend and backend.
First Week: Focused on design and backend development.
Second Week: Worked on the frontend.
Third Week: Connected the frontend and backend, cleaned up code, improved functions, managed error handling, resolved bugs, and applied final styling. 
Google Lighthouse and cross-browser testing show satisfactory results.
