For Technigo Review: Be advised this is a page in progress. We have a functioning main branch with everything for the code review. But inside the code you will find unfinished or not connected components or pages we set up for future implementations. Also there are part in the backend which are not implemented in the frontend yet.

# Final project

This is the final project of our Web Development Bootcamp at Technigo.
We created an e-commerce website for skincare products. The special thing about our app is that users can specify their allergies and preferences. This way you get recommended products that suit you.
We worked in a group of three people and realised this project in 3 to 4 weeks, including planning and testing.

## The problem

We started planning in Figma for the design and in Notion for the tasks. In the first week we worked separately in backend, frontend and Figma. From the second week onwards, we brought everything together. In the end, it was mainly about fixing bugs and testing everything. We will continue to work on this project and add more things in the coming months.
