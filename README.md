## Project Description:

We have created a kids' clothes e-commerce store with a clean landing page that showcases products from a database, with detailed product views and a functional cart/checkout system integrated with Stripe for test payments.

### Technologies

The store is developed with React JS & Vite for us to achieve a fast & optimized web app. For building robust APIs we used Express. The database is built using MongoDB for scalable and flexible data storage. Stripe Test API is integrated for secure and scalable payment processing, which was a bit of a challenge for us, since it was our first time implementing a third party solution. Lastly, for image storage, we used cloudinary.

## How to Install & Run the Project

1.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
2.  Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## How to Use the Project

To explore our kids' clothes e-commerce store, navigate through the product categories using the menu or click on all products in hero. Add items to your cart by clicking "Add to Cart" on the product page, then proceed to checkout where you can simulate a payment using Stripe's test mode.

## Future ToDo

To develop the app further, we would like to add user registration/login, enabeling adding products to favorites, more inspirational pages as well as filtering- and sorting possibilities.
