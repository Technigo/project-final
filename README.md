# Final Project

ParkHive is a website about introducing national parks both in Finland and Sweden.  For nature lovers in Sweden and Finland to gather information about national parks. 

## The problem

- This is the first project we combine both frontend and backend. Setting database is relatively easy since our data is small. But we want to make the website as real as possible, we want user can save parks to their own account, we had to change the api for adding and removing parks. We also use localStorage to keep the data. Now once the user login.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) has been implemented in our work to display each parks' location. At the beginning we use the default code but the marker didn't show on the map after deployment. We checked the official website again as well as youtube to find other people's solution. In the end, we use custom icon instead of default marker. 

- It was not hard if only use libraries' code, but to figure out the customize one was not easy especially in a limited time. For example, the arrows of carousel, marker icon of the map. We will work on cusomized arrows of carousel later. 

## Documentation

We have documented all the resources and libraries in separate README files for both the backend and frontend. You can find the detailed documentation in the respective directories:
- [Backend README](./backend/README.md)
- [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)

## Design inspiration

Our website design was mainly inpired by [Visit Finland](https://www.visitfinland.com/en/), combined with our own style to create ParkHive. 
We also took inspiration from [Sk√•ne](https://visitskane.com/).
