## Development process

## 1 Step
We designed the interface in Figma, established the primary database models, and set up the main server routes.
## 2 Step
We set up all the backend endpoints for user registration and login, and on the frontend, we implemented the forms and main component.
## 3 Step
We implemented a model for travels and stored points in the backend. On the frontend, we integrated all necessary travel forms, graphs, and components.
## 4 Step
We integrated the admin functionality and its dashboard and worked on the final documentation.To make the whole app more user-friendly we integrated a walkthrough.

## Extra features
If we had more time we would start integrate the following features:
- Rewards for points
- Weather data 
- Add a function for display the password to the user when they log in 
- AI coach integration.
- Add function for the user to upload their profile image to Cloudinary.
- Integrate carbon footprints API.
