## Libraries and recources

During the process of our final project, it was fun to explore more libraries for implementation.

1. Weather in Helsinki and stockholm will be displayed on web pages. 
- Regarding the time zone, we use [Moment Timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/)
- External API [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/current)
- Icon 

2. Back-to-top button
- [react-scroll-to-top](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-to-top)

3. Map for each parks
- Since Google map API is only for free 3 months, so we use [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) instead of using Google Map. 

4. Carousel
- We use [react-multi-carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-multi-carousel) for displaying parks.

5. Styling
- Tailwind CSS

6. Timezone
- This website introduces parks from two countries: Finland and Sweden. [Moment Timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) has been used. 

7. Animation
- [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) when data is loading.

8. Forms
- Signup, login forms and parks' rating: [MUI](https://mui.com/)
